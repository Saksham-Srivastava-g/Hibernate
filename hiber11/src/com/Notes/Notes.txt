`hibernate mappings 

in one to one mapping we solve problem that can be in emebbed that for examplea a person
can have multiple bank account by one to many or hibernate mapping we can create another table with 
accont ehre eid is passed a foreign key in another table.
   types of mapping 
   1 one to one
   2 one to many
   3 many to one 
   4 many to many
   
   
   ONE TO ONE 
   in unidirectional there will foreign in emp table with acc number to link where the account details are stored
   cascading : if there is change in parent mapped class all changed 
   propertes : casacade.all (any crud performed on all mapped) , cascade.remove(in only delete all apped tbale will be affected)
   in unidirectionl if we get read data from account we cant get employee data and vice versa
   
   
   so we need bidirectional 
   
   a way of creating birection we can also add emp filed in account and apply type
    of mapping like one to one then cascade but for reading we need to create tostring that can cause tostring overstack boh of them is callin geach other
    
    
    ONE TO MANY 
      
      
      mappedby Property
      
      we can elimanete another foregn key from one table
      use mapped by oppiste in in which joincolumn is there
      
      in  one to many hibernate create one more table of eid and accnumber column for without mappedby
